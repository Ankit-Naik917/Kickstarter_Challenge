Overview of the Project  <br />
  Background <br />
    Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. From the analysis done so far Louise was able to identify the outcomes of different projects based on category, subcategory, country and year. <br />
    <br /> Purpose <br /> 
    This analysis is carried out to provide a better visualization to Louise on how different campaigns have fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. <br />
    
 Results <br />
    
Theater Outcomes by Launch Date <br />
		1) May to August are good months for a successful launch of the campaign under theatre parent category. These month have highest number of successfully launched campaigns. Moreover, Months May and June have 200% chances of the campaign being successful than failing <br />
		2) December is the worst month to kickstart a campaign as the data suggest that the chances of a successful and failed campaign is close to 50 - 50% <br />
    <br />
	Outcomes based on Goals <br />
		1) There are no cancelled outcomes under "plays" subcategory regardless the goal value. As the goal value starts increasing the percentage of the outcome being successful starts declining. If Louise wants to launch another campaign then the goal should be less than $5000 to improve the chances of being it successful. <br />
    <br />
	Limitation and Recommendation <br />
		The analysis is completed based on outcome using the goal and pledged values in different countries and by year. The charts launch date and goal does not provide a full picture on why the event failed or canceled. A recommendation to add another column describing the type of the play would help identify what type of plays are more sucessful compared to other plays.
